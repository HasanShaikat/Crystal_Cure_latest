                        <span >Rats are small to medium-sized rodents known for their pointed snouts, long tails, and sharp incisor teeth. They are highly adaptable creatures found in various habitats worldwide, often living in close proximity to human dwellings. Rats are known to cause damage by gnawing on structures, wires, and even through food containers. They can transmit diseases and parasites, posing health risks to humans. Due to their rapid breeding and elusive nature, rat infestations can become severe quickly, often requiring professional pest control measures to manage and eliminate them effectively.</span>

                        <span >Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on blood, typically at night while people are sleeping. These pests can hide in cracks and crevices around beds, furniture, and other items, making them difficult to detect and eradicate. Bedbug bites can cause itchy welts on the skin and, while they are not known to transmit diseases, their presence can lead to stress and sleep disturbances. Effective elimination often requires professional pest control measures to completely eradicate infestations.</span>

                        <span >Termites are small, pale insects that feed on wood and other materials containing cellulose. Known as silent destroyers, they can cause extensive damage to wooden structures, furniture, and even books, clothing, and insulation. Their ability to chew through wood often goes unnoticed until significant damage is done. Forming large colonies, termites work silently, making them a challenging pest to detect and control. Professional pest management is usually necessary to effectively eliminate termite infestations and prevent further structural damage.</span>

                        <span >Cockroaches are resilient insects characterized by their flattened bodies and long antennae. They thrive in various environments and are notorious for their adaptability and quick breeding cycles. Often found in kitchens, bathrooms, and other warm, humid spaces, these pests scavenge for food and can contaminate surfaces. While not directly harmful, they can pose health risks by carrying pathogens and triggering allergies. Cockroach infestations require prompt attention and typically necessitate professional pest control measures for effective eradication.</span>

                        <span >Mosquitoes are small flying insects known for their slender bodies, two wings, and long, thin mouthparts used for feeding on blood. They are commonly found in various habitats worldwide, particularly in warm and humid environments. While both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar, it&apos;s the female mosquito that requires a blood meal to lay eggs. Their bites can cause itching and, in some cases, transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, and West Nile virus. Mosquito control often involves the elimination of standing water where they breed and can also include the use of repellents and insecticides to reduce their population.</span>
